rosedb is a fast, stable, and embedded NoSQL database based on `bitcask`, supports a variety of data structures such as `string`, `list`, `hash`, `set`, and `sorted set`.     

It is similar to `Redis` but store values on disk.

Key features:

* **Many data structures: `string`, `list`, `hash`, `set`, and `sorted set`**
* **Easy to embed into your own Go application**
* **High performance, suitable for both read and write intensive workload**
* **Values are not limited by RAM**
